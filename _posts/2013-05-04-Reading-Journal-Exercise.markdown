There’s Agile Coach Square program provided by Agile Consulting. This is very famous program even though its price is high. so every term has been closed very fast and if you are hesitate to participate in, there would be no more vacancy for you.
I wanted to have this program for a long time but I couldn’t get supporting from my company. I decided my mind to apply this with my own money. luckily I could get a chance to have this consulting program early April, 2012 and program will start from June 11 for 3 months.
Coach recommended 3 activities before having this consulting and those are “Reading, Journal and Exercise” and I added one more thing - “stop drinking” :-)
Please wish a good luck to me
